This code can be run with Jupyter notebook 'AL experiments'. You will need the following packages: numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, scipy, time, scipy, math, pickle. 'AL experiment' guides you through the nain steps. It uses classed from folder./Classes, data for experiments is stored in ./data, data for learning a strategy is stored in ./lal datasets and the results are written into ./exp. Class ActiveLearner implements methods Random, Uncertainty Sampling and LAL. For more details refer to the paper and comments in the code.
